# Orion API Helper

***

## Introduction

***

This program is a helper for the Orion API. It is used to utilize the Orion API to retrieve video stream data and containers
and will be part of a pipeline to create a media library independent of Kodi. Personally, Kodi has seemed a bit monolithic
and I would like a program that is simple and easy to use. I want to be able to just search for a video and play it, without
worrying about a library and databases, etc. I am more interested in the ability to find the exact torrents I seek and 
see if they are cached than I care about the videos themselves. So it's really a glorified search engine and not a video
library.

The first feature to be implemented is a search engine that will allow the user to search using a torrent magnet link as a
 query and get a list of results that are cached on Real Debrid.
